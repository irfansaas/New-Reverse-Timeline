## Conclusion

This roadmap is aggressive but achievable with a focused team. The key is to:
1. **Start with solid foundations** (calculations & data models)
2. **Build incrementally** (working features at each stage)
3. **Test continuously** (don't wait until the end)
4. **Get feedback early** (from real users)
5. **Stay focused** (resist scope creep)

Remember: You're not just building a tool, you're building a competitive advantage for Nerdio's sales team. Every feature should accelerate deal velocity and increase win rates.

Let's build something amazing! ðŸš€
